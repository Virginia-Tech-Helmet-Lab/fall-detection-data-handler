Technical Specification Document
1. Overview
Project Name: Fall Detection Data Preprocessor and Annotator
Objective:
 Develop a robust, user-friendly software application to ingest, normalize, and label variable-length fall detection videos. The system will support:
* Importing videos.
* Applying normalization adjustments.
* A dedicated labeling interface to annotate fall events (with temporal boundaries) and create bounding boxes for key body parts (head, shoulder, etc.).
* Final review of annotations.
* Batch processing with progress tracking.
Target Users:
 Researchers and data scientists working on deep learning models for fall detection in elderly populations.

2. User Experience Flow
Step 1: Import Your Data
* Functionality:
   * Upload one or multiple video files.
   * Support for various formats and variable metadata (length, resolution, framerate).
   * Bulk import with a progress indicator.
* UI Elements:
   * File picker/upload dialog.
   * Display of imported video list with basic metadata.
Step 2: Normalize Data
* Functionality:
   * Present normalization options such as resolution standardization, framerate alignment, brightness/contrast adjustments.
   * Provide a preview (“bubbles” or interactive adjustment panels) of the normalization effect.
* UI Elements:
   * Panel with checkboxes or sliders for each normalization parameter.
   * Preview area showing before/after effects.
   * “Apply” button to process all imported videos.
Step 3: Labeling Interface
* Layout: Three-Panel Design:
   * Left Panel:
      * List of video names/IDs.
      * Display only unlabeled videos; labeled videos are automatically removed (or moved to a “completed” section).
   * Center Panel:
      * Video playback area with scrubbing, pause/play, and frame-by-frame controls.
      * A timeline showing annotated events (if any).
   * Right Panel:
      * Annotation controls:
         * Temporal Annotation: Buttons/controls to mark the start and end of a fall event.
         * Bounding Box Tool: Interface to draw, adjust, and label bounding boxes (e.g., head, shoulder, etc.).
         * Save/Update annotations.
      * Progress indicator and navigation buttons.
* Functionality:
   * Allow manual annotation of fall events by marking start and end times.
   * Enable drawing and adjusting bounding boxes over video frames.
   * Auto-save feature to persist progress and allow users to resume work.
* UI Elements:
   * Video player with controls (play, pause, scrubbing, step forward/back).
   * Annotation tool overlays for bounding boxes with resize/move handles.
   * List or tree view of current annotations (with labels, e.g., “fall event”, “head”, “shoulder”).
   * Save and Next buttons.
Step 4: Final Review Page
* Functionality:
   * Display a summary of labeled videos with overlays of fall events and bounding boxes.
   * Allow users to review and optionally edit annotations.
* UI Elements:
   * Video playback with annotation overlay.
   * Side-by-side list of videos and their associated metadata and annotations.
   * “Edit” and “Confirm” actions for each video.
Step 5: Completion and Batch Processing
* Functionality:
   * Once all videos in the current batch are labeled, a final confirmation page summarizes the session.
   * Option to return to the main screen to import the next batch.
* UI Elements:
   * Dashboard view with batch statistics.
   * Button to “Complete Batch” and a link to return to the main screen.

3. System Architecture
Frontend
* Framework:
   * A modern JavaScript framework such as React or Vue.js.
* Components:
   * Data Import Component: File upload interface with metadata extraction.
   * Normalization Component: Interactive panels for normalization settings.
   * Video Player Component: Custom video player with scrubbing and frame-by-frame control.
   * Annotation Panel: Tools for temporal and spatial (bounding box) annotation.
   * Review Dashboard: Aggregated view for final review of annotations.
* Interaction:
   * Real-time feedback on annotation actions.
   * Auto-save functionality using local storage or direct API calls.
Backend
* Framework:
   * A RESTful API built with Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js.
* Services:
   * Data Management:
      * File storage (local/cloud) for raw and processed videos.
      * Database for storing metadata, normalization settings, and annotations (SQL or NoSQL).
   * Processing Engine:
      * Video normalization module (using FFmpeg or similar libraries).
      * Annotation data management (CRUD operations for annotation records).
* API Endpoints:
   * /upload – For video import.
   * /normalize – To apply normalization settings.
   * /annotations – GET/POST/PUT for retrieving and saving annotations.
   * /review – Endpoint for fetching final review data.
Integration
* Communication:
   * Frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API endpoints.
   * Real-time updates using websockets (optional) for auto-save and progress indicators.
* Data Persistence:
   * Videos stored on file system or cloud storage.
   * Annotation metadata stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB).

4. Data Model
Video Metadata
* Attributes:
   * video_id (unique identifier)
   * filename
   * resolution
   * framerate
   * duration
   * import_date
   * normalization_settings (JSON blob)
Annotation Model
* Temporal Annotation:
   * annotation_id
   * video_id
   * start_time (or frame index)
   * end_time (or frame index)
   * label (e.g., “fall event”)
* Bounding Box Annotation:
   * bbox_id
   * video_id
   * frame_index
   * x, y, width, height (coordinates)
   * part_label (e.g., “head”, “shoulder”)
Batch/Session Data
* Attributes:
   * session_id
   * user_id
   * batch_status (in-progress, completed)
   * list_of_video_ids (array)

5. Additional Features and Considerations
Auto-Save and Resume
* Auto-Save:
   * Automatically save progress periodically or on every annotation action.
* Resume Work:
   * Remove labeled videos from the left panel; provide an option to view/edit labeled videos if needed.
Bounding Box Tools
* Functionality:
   * Tools to draw, resize, and reposition boxes.
   * Option to label each box with a predefined set of body parts.
* Integration:
   * The bounding boxes’ coordinates are saved along with the current frame index and associated with the corresponding video annotation record.
Final Review Interface
* Functionality:
   * Allow users to review video annotations with overlaid bounding boxes and temporal markers.
   * Option to edit or approve annotations before finalizing the batch.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
* Performance:
   * Smooth playback and responsive UI even with high-resolution videos.
   * Fast video normalization and processing times.
* Usability:
   * Intuitive interface for both novice and advanced users.
   * Clear instructions and tooltips throughout the application.
* Scalability:
   * Ability to handle large batches of videos and concurrent users (if deployed in a multi-user environment).
* Security:
   * Secure file uploads.
   * User authentication and authorization if multi-user capabilities are added.
* Reliability:
   * Robust error handling during video import, normalization, and annotation processes.
   * Data persistence to prevent loss of work during sessions.

7. Deployment and Future Enhancements
* Deployment Options:
   * Web-based application hosted on cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) or as a desktop application using Electron.
* Future Enhancements:
   * Integration with machine learning models for automated fall detection and pre-labeling.
   * Collaborative annotation with multiple users working on the same batch.
   * Detailed analytics on annotation metrics and model performance review.

8. Summary
This technical spec outlines the design for a complete data preprocessing and annotation software tailored for fall detection video datasets. The system emphasizes:
* A multi-step user flow from data import to final review.
* A robust normalization process.
* A highly interactive labeling interface with both temporal and bounding box annotations.
* A backend API for processing and persisting data.
* Scalability and usability for research applications.
This document should serve as a comprehensive guide for your engineering team to build a prototype and eventually a production-ready tool for your research project.
