1. Project Summary
Project Name: Fall Detection Data Preprocessor and Annotator
Objective:
 Build a comprehensive, user-friendly software tool that enables researchers to import, normalize, and annotate videos for fall detection. The system will handle variable-length videos, support normalization, and provide detailed labeling (temporal and bounding box) to generate high-quality training data for deep learning models.
End Goal:
 A fully integrated web application (or desktop app) that lets users process a batch of videos, annotate fall events (and key body parts), review annotations, and then export the annotated dataset for further model training and research.

2. Project Scope
* Frontend:
 A responsive UI with multiple views:

   * Data Import & Metadata Extraction
   * Normalization Controls & Preview
   * Labeling Interface: A three-panel layout with video playback, annotation controls (temporal and bounding box), and progress tracking.
   * Final Review Dashboard for validating and editing annotations.
   * Backend:
 RESTful API services to handle:

      * Video uploads and storage.
      * Video normalization processing (using libraries like FFmpeg).
      * CRUD operations for annotations and session management.
      * Data persistence in a database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
      * Integration & Deployment:
 Seamless integration between the frontend and backend, a robust CI/CD pipeline, and deployment on cloud services or as a standalone application.

 Frontend initialized and integrated with the backend for data import.
________________


Phase 4: Normalization Module
         * Task 4.1: Build the Normalization UI:
         * Sliders, checkboxes, and preview panels for resolution, framerate, and brightness/contrast.
         * Task 4.2: Implement backend normalization logic and integrate with the UI.
         * Task 4.3: Ensure normalization settings are saved and applied to videos.
Milestone:
 A fully functional normalization module, including UI preview and backend processing.
________________


Phase 5: Labeling Interface Development
         * Task 5.1: Create the three-panel Labeling Interface:
         * Left Panel: Video list with progress tracking.
         * Center Panel: Custom video player with scrubbing, play/pause, and frame-by-frame controls.
         * Right Panel: Annotation tools for marking temporal boundaries and drawing bounding boxes.
         * Task 5.2: Develop the Bounding Box Tool:
         * Drawing, resizing, and labeling (e.g., head, shoulder) directly on the video frames.
         * Task 5.3: Implement auto-save functionality for annotations and update UI accordingly.
Milestone:
 The full labeling interface is operational, with smooth video playback and annotation capabilities.
________________


Phase 6: Final Review & Batch Processing
         * Task 6.1: Develop the Final Review Dashboard to display annotated videos.
         * Task 6.2: Allow users to edit or confirm annotations.
         * Task 6.3: Implement batch processing logic to manage sessions and prepare the final output.

         * Task 7.1: Conduct unit, integration, and user acceptance testing across both frontend and backend.
         * Task 7.2: Address bugs and iterate based on feedback.
         * Task 7.3: Prepare deployment scripts and documentation (CI/CD pipeline, Docker, cloud deployment).
         * Task 7.4: Deploy to a staging environment for final validation.
Milestone:
 Project passes QA, is deployed to staging/production, and documentation is complete.

6. Conclusion
From a project management perspective, the repository begins with a clear definition of both the repository structure and the initial setup (Phase 1). Development progresses through backend and frontend foundational work (Phases 2 and 3), followed by the core functionalities—normalization, labeling interface, and final review (Phases 4 to 6). Testing and deployment wrap up the project (Phase 7), and a maintenance plan is established (Phase 8). This complete project overview ensures a structured, phased approach that aligns with the technical spec while keeping the end-user experience and research objectives in clear focus.
This roadmap provides the engineering team with a clear starting point and end-goal, ensuring that every component—from the initial repository setup to the final product—is systematically built, tested, and deployed.
